# we begin with creation of a basic class
# class TestClass:                         # a class must be named in pascal case and the rest in snake or camel
#     test_var = 'This is test var!'
#     another_var = (1,2,3,4,5)

#     def new_func(self):           #when creating functions inside the class, we should assign them self by convention
#         func_variable = 'This the new function created'
#         print(self.another_var)
# # we shall then create an instance, this is when we over-right the class name
# test_class = TestClass()
# test = TestClass()   anything can work as an instance

# # when printing anything under the class, it should bbe the first and then a '.' 
# print(test_class.test_var)
# print(test_class.new_func)
# test_class.new_func()


# dunder methods  dunder denotes double underscore
# they are used in order to simplify the code, for example __init__ is used to create new variables
